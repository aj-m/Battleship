If you want to update the function you're working on, email me (Andrew Montenigro) at my Prin email...
OR send me the updated file over Facebook...
and I'll update the main file with it.

OR

If you make a GitHub account, you can subscribe to this repository and I should be able to give you commit permissions
or at least something that lets you submit updates through GitHub so we don't have to go through the email rigmarole.
